## How to use this tool?

1. Download the split.py script and save it in a directory along with your .txt files.
2. Ensure that your Happy Scribe transcriptions are in the same directory as your .py and .txt files. /!\ Please confirm that your .txt files are in the same format as Example.txt.
3. Open the command prompt and navigate to your directory (e.g. if your .py and .txt files are in the "happyscribe" directory on your desktop, type the following command: > cd Desktop > cd happyscribe)
4. Type the following command: python split.py [name of your text].txt (e.g. "python split.py Example.txt")
5. Voila! Your utterances are now in a CSV file.
